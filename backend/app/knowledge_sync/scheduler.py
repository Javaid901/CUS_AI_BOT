"""DEPRECATED — scheduled sync for the legacy Knowledge Sync pipeline.

The legacy pipeline (``app.knowledge_sync.engine``) is no longer exposed by
any route; scheduled website syncing is provided by the Website Knowledge
Sync engine's own scheduler (``app.knowledge_sync.web_scheduler``), which is
started in ``app.main`` and controlled from the admin dashboard. This module
is retained as an internal, unreferenced legacy artifact.

Enabled via KNOWLEDGE_SYNC_SCHEDULE.
