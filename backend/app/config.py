"""
backend/app/config.py

Central application configuration via environment variables.
Uses pydantic-settings so values can be supplied by a .env file or the OS env.

Database:
  - Default metadata store is SQLite so the service runs with zero external setup.
  - Set DATABASE_URL to a PostgreSQL connection string to use Postgres (e.g. via docker-compose).

LLM / Embeddings:
  - Both run through Ollama (on-premise). The model names are configurable.
